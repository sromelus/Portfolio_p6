            | My name is Shardly. I live in Boston, MA and I've been coding since 2017. I started coding mostly as a hobby using vanilla JavaScript and Ruby to build simple command-line applications that were really cool to me. In late 2018, I dove deeper into learning more about programming - more specifically web development. In early 2019, I attended a bootcamp where I gained practical experience as an Apprentice Full Stack Web developer working with PostgreSQL, Rails, Ruby and Sinatra. This portfolio showcases some of the projects that I have built and some that are currently in the works. Please take some time to view some of my projects and don't hesitate to reach out. I am always curious to know more about new technologies and willing to learn new and innovative ways to write better and more efficient software.
