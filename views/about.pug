            |  My name is Shardly, I live in Boston, MA. I've been coding since 2017. I started coding mostly as a hobby using vanila javascript and ruby to build simple command line applications that were really cool to me at the time.
            |  In late 2018, I dove deeper into coding I wanted to know more about websites and how the web works. In early 2019, I attended a bootcamp that hepled further developed my skillset as a developer.  
            |  This portfolio showcase some of the projects that I have built and some that are currently in the works. Please take some time to review my projects and don't hesitate to reach out.
            |  I am always curious to know more about the industry and willing to know new innovative ways to write better and more efficient code.
